# Umbrellexql

This is a starter app to quickly bootstrap a graphl API umbrella application. The easiest way is to click the green "Use this template" button above. Github will then create a repo for you that you can name what you like, with the same files and folders in this template. Then all you'll need to do is replace this:

```elixir
defmodule Umbrellexql.MixProject do
```

With this:

```elixir
defmodule YourAppsName.MixProject do
```
